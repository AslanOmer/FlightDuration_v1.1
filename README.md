FlightDuration_v1.0
===================

This is a flight duration calculator. The results are of course estimated but with this you could have an idea of how to manage your schedules when adding them. 
This is an open source module, so feel free if you want to make changes.

Install:

1. Download the zip.
2. Unzip &amp; upload in the order of folder structure.
3. Make a link to access it by <?php echo url('duration');?>.
4. Enjoy.
