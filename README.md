FlightDuration_v1.0
===================

This is a flight duration calculator. The results are of course estimated but with this you could have an idea of how to manage your schedules when adding them. 
This is an open source module, so feel free if you want to make changes.

Note: I have changed .tpl files. Also, a data class has been added for time format so no more hassle. The calculations are now more accurate.

Install:

1. Download the zip.
2. Unzip and upload in the order of folder structure.
3. Make a link to access it by <?php echo url('duration');?>.
4. Enjoy.
